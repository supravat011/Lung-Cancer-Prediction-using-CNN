ABSTRACT

Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with early detection being critical for improving patient survival rates. This project presents an automated lung cancer classification system that leverages deep learning techniques to analyze chest CT scan images and classify them into four distinct categories: Normal, Adenocarcinoma, Large Cell Carcinoma, and Squamous Cell Carcinoma. The system employs transfer learning using the Xception convolutional neural network architecture, pre-trained on ImageNet, combined with custom classification layers optimized for medical imaging. The model achieves approximately 93% accuracy on test data, demonstrating robust performance in distinguishing between different lung cancer types and normal tissue. The implementation includes a user-friendly command-line interface that allows medical professionals and researchers to obtain rapid predictions with confidence scores for each classification category. The system processes images in 1-2 seconds, making it suitable for preliminary screening and research applications. By automating the initial classification process, this tool has the potential to assist radiologists in prioritizing cases and reducing diagnostic time, ultimately contributing to earlier detection and improved patient outcomes.
